### Questions
 - the `amount of deliveries being requested` does not seem to feature in the UI at <https://www.bloomandwild.com/send-flowers>. So I have made this a multiplier of the bouquet price, but not the delivery price.

### Issues
 - there is a bug with the angular-uib-datepicker where clicking on a date with a `custom class` then only re-renders dates on and after the date clicked (not before). Seems to be referenced here: https://github.com/angular-ui/bootstrap/issues/4626
